The rise of online grocery shopping has revolutionized the retail industry in recent years, with 
more and more consumers turning to e-commerce platforms to purchase their everyday essentials. 
As a result, it has become increasingly important for retailers to understand consumer preferences 
and behaviors in order to remain competitive in the marketplace. This project seeks to explore the 
sales trends and patterns of two major online grocery stores, Big Basket and D-Mart, with the aim 
of answering several key research questions.


The comparison of sales and market prices for grocery products in both stores shows that most 
products are sold at a higher price than their market price, with some exceptions. The line chart 
visualization indicates that BigBasket tends to sell products at higher prices compared to Dmart, 
with a larger gap in certain categories. This could be due to various factors such as different 
sourcing strategies, product quality, and target audience.

The analysis of the top brands, categories, and subcategories sold in both stores provides insights 
into the consumer preferences and market trends. The donut chart visualization shows that some 
brands have higher profit margins than others, which could be attributed to their pricing strategy, 
product quality, and popularity.
